Merry Christmas Luke, and _Feliz Navidad_!

Welcome to your very special webpage dedicated to your 2022 Christmas card extravaganza! 

So much has changed for both of us over the past year, there is so many points to cover. Might as well cover it chronologically... 

First, your crushing it in med school and is so fucking impressive to watch. Is it a bummer that you couldn't come on vacay this year? Sure, but your dedication to learning and perfecting the craft of medicine is un-freaking-believable.

Next up, your engaged and planning a wedding that I cannot wait for. I love you and Caroline, it really seems like you two are the perfect match for each other. Not only do you have similar interests, but it seems likely you two truly understand each other. 

Finally, we come to the matter at hand. Da Fuq are you coming to visit Colorado? I know school is tough (see point one), but I have so much to show you and do with you. So many activities! Skiing, hiking, camping, fishing. So much to do, and thats just scratching the surface. I know you'll eventually make it out here though. Just waiting. Impatiently.

Honestly I am so grateful for your support with all the changes I've made over the last year too. Without your encouragement and guidance, it would have been a tough move out here. I am incredibly lucky to have such an amazing older brother to show me the way. 

Love ya, 

Con
