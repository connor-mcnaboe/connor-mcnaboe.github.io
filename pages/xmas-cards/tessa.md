Merry Christmas Tessa, and _Feliz Navidad_!

This is your very special Christmas Webpage dedicated to your 2022 Christmas card. Hope you enjoy the riveting content to follow... 

First off, congratulations on making it through a grueling, challenging and ultimately fulfilling year. I know how much has happened to you this past year, so lets review: 

New York City: Life in the big city looks good on ya. Yeah, things are expensive and hard to get to and sometimes the subways are flooded... but your living it up in the Big Apple none the less and absolutely crushing it too. I really wish I was able to come visit before moving out west, but ce la vi. 

The Middle Eastern Excursion: Holy shit you went all the way to Abu Dhabi _by yourself_ and kicked some serious ass. From what it sounds like, you where able to use that time to reflect internally and grow from the experience, and that is the best outcome after dealing with a bit of adversity. 

A Rough Fall Semester: Shit happens, and you dealt with the fallout gracefully and professionally. And are better off after anyways! So fuq yea, move along, nothing to see here. 

Finally, this is my veryyyyy grateful thank you for making the effort to come visit me and Jill this March on your way to the wedding. We are going to have soooo much fun on our desert/mountain adventure. Get ready to live it up where the space is large and the skys are full.  

Love you big time, 

Con
