<h1 style="text-align:center">Merry Christmas Dad!</h1>

Merry Christmas Dad, or _Feliz Navidad_ I guess I should say! 

So many things come to mind when I reflect on our past year together. Even though we may have been on other sides of the country for most of it, I still feel like you are close by. The weekly Zoom calls, or the random texts makes me feel like you are still just a few towns over, instead of many states away. 

I am so grateful to have your support over the past year. Your encouragement to follow my dreams to get a new job, move west gave me confidence that I was making the right decision. 

I cannot wait for you and Mom to get out here and explore some of the amazing places in Colorado. While the pizza and beer isn't exactly as good as some of the places back in CT, I think you'll love the sights and mountains. And honestly, the beer is pretty good too, but I know how particular you are ;)  

I hope we enjoy our time in Spain together, and come back stateside with plenty of new stories to tell and memories to cherish. 

Love you more than Steve Cohen can spend, 

Con
