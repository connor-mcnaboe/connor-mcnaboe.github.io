<h1 style="text-align:center">Merry Christmas Mom!</h1>

Merry Christmas Mom, and _Feliz Navidad_!

The past year has been quite a shake up from 2021? We've both had lots of changes and things to adjust to, and for the most part all good things too. I know its been hard having most of us so far away, and I am so thankful that you support and encouragement to live my dreams despite the that challenge. And anyways, before you know it, I'm sure we'll be headed back to New England (although I cannot guarantee how long exactly "before you know it" will be). 

But seriously, looking back on the past half year, I did not feel like you where that far away. The weekend Zoom calls and hilarious voice memos made it feel like you where still only a few towns away. I know I have not been the best at staying in touch, and it's something I really want to work on for 2023. 

And I'm not the only one shaking things up! I am so hyped that you are getting your real estate license and returning to your journey into staging/design and now marketing. I really think I got my passion for leaning new things from you, and it shows with this new adventure you are on. 

I really can't wait for you to come out to visit, I know you have already seen some of the sights and attractions when you came last, but hopefully I can show you some of the things I've come to enjoy about living our here (fly fishing, maybe?). 

I know we will enjoy our time in Spain together, and return stateside with plenty of memories to cherish and stories to tell.

Love you to Mars and beyond, 

Con
