<h1 style="text-align:center">Merry Christmas Jill!</h1>

Merry Christmas Jill, or _Feliz Navidad_ I guess I should say! 

I am so thankful to have such an intelligent, passionate and  of course beautiful girlfriend in my life. I am the best version of myself because of you, every day you teach me a new way to see the world. 

We have been on so many adventures together, especially this past year. Moving to Colorado has been some of the best months of my life, and I cannot wait to continue to experience it with you by my side. 

I love you so much, to Mars, to the edge of the galaxy, to the edge of the universe and back. You are the love of my life, and I don't want it any other way. 

Love you tons, 

Con
