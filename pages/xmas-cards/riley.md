Merry Christmas Riley, and _Feliz Navidad_!

Goddamn so much has happened over the past year, lets start at the beginning because this isn't the plot of Westworld. 

First, not only did you graduate from UConn, but you did it with an amazing GPA and as a member of the honors program (and for free, no too shabby). Its genuinely impressive what you accomplished at UConn, and I'm hyped that you are going back to continue your academic pursuits.

Next, you went to Spain to "study" (Im sure your working hard but lets not kid ourselves). I'd say I'm really jealous of you, but I've got my own adventures cooking so im only kinda jealous of you. It looks and sounds like your having an amazing time out there, and I'm **hyped** to get to share a bit of this week with you. 

Finally, lets review your performance in year one of the Fantasy Football League. After a questionable draft, you seem to have pulled your fellas up by the bootstraps and gotten yourself into the playoffs, so congrats there. More than I can say for my broken squad...

When you get back from Spain, we can't wait to get your ass on a plane again out to CO. Lots to do and see; I'm sure I can find a pair of waders about your size...

Looking forward to the memories/stories we will create this week in Spain. 

Love ya, 

Con
